<!--Terminology:
    TABLES
    <table> tag creats tables. Inside its starting and ending tags we have to put <tr> tag which creates table raws.
Inside <tr> starting and ending tags we have <td> in order to display table data for each column. <th> tag stands 
for table header and it extinguishes header raw from the rest. <caption> is used to give a title to your table.
colspan="" is an attribute of <td> tag and it is used when we want to merge raws. For example, if we gave colspan="3"
it would take 3 columns and merge them. Everything else in this 2nd and 3rd columns would be pushed aside.
