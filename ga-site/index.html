<!--Terminology:
    INPUT & FORMS
    <input type=""/> input tags allow you to take inputs from users. And type="" here defines what kind of features
should be displayed in order to get data from the users. For instance, type="text" allows the users to enter a small
piece of text. type="password" is another attribute which displays password window where the users are also allowed 
to type their password but here the given text is hidden. The value="" attribute makes it feasible to automatically 
have text inside these text windows. Another attribute is type="date" and it allows to the users to set a date for
upfront determined matter. Next is type="range" which is really cool when you want an user to set some range for a
particular purpose. type="file" is used to upload files. Next comes type="checkbox" which is used to mark certain
things. Here you are able to mark couple of checkboxes. But another attribute which is type="radio" won't allow it
to an user if they have the same attribute name="". The last attribute is type="submit" and it is used for submitting
files.
    <textarea> is the tag which allows us to have a big window of typing text inside which can also be reshaped straight
from the web page. We can also define the size of it in advance by giving two additional attributes, namely rows="" and
cols="".
    <form> this tag is used only for wrapping. It does not really do anything except making your code look more 
understandable and what kind of codes are going to be in one line.
