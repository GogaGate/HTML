<!--Terminology:
    Videos & Youtube iFrames
    <video src=""> is used when we want to add videos on our website. Between the starting and eniding tags
you can write whatever you want and it will be only displayed in case a web browser can not open the format
of the given video. Controls attribute is essential to be able to play the video. Otherwise, you won't be able.
Here, as the case of the images, we can use heigh and width attributes. You can only give the tag one of them
and it will adjust based the aspect ratio. Poster attribute makes it feasible to have whatever starting scree 
we want to have on the video. Loop attribute starts the video again as soon as it is finished automatically.
    In order to use youtube videos on our website, we have to find a video and below it there is a share sign,
where we find Embeded. After clicking on it, Youtube gives us HTML code which we have to copy and past in our 
code editor.
