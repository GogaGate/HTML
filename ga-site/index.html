<!--Terminology: 
    <html> tag here is a "parent" tag of <head> and <body>. 
    <head> and <body> are the "child" tags of their parent tag, <html>. 
    Tags under same parent are called sibling tags. 
    Any other inner tags, for instance <p> tag here, become the child tag of the tag which is one level up and "grandchild"
of its parent tag. 
    Container tags means that there are two tags, starting tag and ending tag and you can put other tags inside of them.
    <!DOCTYPE html> I'm basically telling my web browser that the type of this document is HTML.
    <html> is a starting tag.
    </html> is an ending tag.
    All of the HTML code and HTML tags are going to be inside starting and ending tags.
    Head and body tags are the essential of any HTML files. Head is sort of a settings of an HTML file.
    Body is a main content of an HTML file. Here you'll most likely see the major stuff.
    <p> is a paragraph tag.
    <title> gives a tab of any web browser the name we want and choose.
