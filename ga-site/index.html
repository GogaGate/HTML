    I-Frames
    <iframe src=""> this tag helps us to display any website we want to. Src is just a place where you have to put
an URL of a particular website. Between starting and ending tags we write whatever we want and it will be displayed
when the website is unavailable at the moment. Frameboarder attribute is used when we want to hide boarders of the
given URL.
