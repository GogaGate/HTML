<!--Terminology: 
    <html> tag here is a "parent" tag of <head> and <body>. 
    <head> and <body> are the "child" tags of their parent tag, <html>. 
    Tags under same parent are called sibling tags. 
    Any other inner tags, for instance <p> tag here, become the child tag of the tag which is one level up and "grandchild"
of its parent tag. 
    Container tags means that there are two tags, starting tag and ending tag and you can put other tags inside of them.
    <!DOCTYPE html> I'm basically telling my web browser that the type of this document is HTML.
    <html> is a starting tag.
    </html> is an ending tag.
    All of the HTML code and HTML tags are going to be inside <HTML> starting and ending tags.
    <head> and <body> tags are the essential of any HTML files. 
    <head> is sort of a settings of an HTML file.
    <body> is a main content of an HTML file. Here you'll most likely see the major stuff.
    <p> is a paragraph tag. Here we write anything we want to display.
    <title> gives a tab of any web browser the name we want and choose.
    <Meta> is basically a tag that defines the information about our file. In our case we use meta tag to define charactor
encoding for my webpage. so, it says to the web browser what types of characters we are using inside of this document. 
    <hX> x here signifies any number from 1 to 6. <h1> tags is used to write something as a header. 1 is the biggest in 
font size, while 6 is the smallest.
    <b> is a bold tag. It bolds the text which is inside <b> text we want to be bold </b>
    <i> is italic font.
    <br/> is a breakline tag. It makes space before the next content.
    <hr/> draws a hotizontal line. 
    <big> tag makes the text inside it bigger.
    <small> tag makes the text inside it smaller.
    <sub> subscrips the text inside it.
    <sup> takes the given text in square.
    We can give tags, so called attributes which define them. In our case, style="" will give a particular tag colors for 
background or font. For instance, <p style="color: red"> will make the font red. <p style="background-color: purple" will
make the background of the given paragraph purple.
